# Shohid-Minar-OpenGL-C-project-

Introduction:
21st February is International Mother Language day. In that day we remember our Martyrs by laying
down flowers to the Martyr’s Monument. It was our dream doing something for them in this Computer
Graphics lab. Fortunately, Sir gave to us Shahid Minar (Martyr’s Monument) project. We feel proud to
finally complete this project.
Tools:
For this lab, we use only OpenGL 3. We use GLUT library to access OpenGL function. For this lab we use
some basic concept from OpenGL this are,
 Transformation
 Timer
 Color
 Lighting
 Textures
 3d text
Feature:
Our project contains this feature.
 Design in perfect scale. We try to design this architecture with perfection.
 Use of texture according to our required. Basically, we use texture for red tiles and ground grass.
 For different type lighting environment, we use Day-Night Lighting combination.
 For perfect observation, we rotate Shahid Minar at 360o.
 For nicely designed the environment we use grass texture, sky texture, and tiles texture.
Unique:
Our project something like put all together. We learning some basic from OpenGL and then we try to
apply this here.
Obstacle:
Our main Challenge was finding coordinate to draw plane for object surface. It was really very
challenging finding original coordinate display it perfectly.
Future work:
Our wish was adding more feature in future here. Like City view, flower dropping on base. We want to
publish in open source for future development. We wish one from us may contribute there for next.
Conclusion:
We are very grateful after completing this project gratefully. We are so happy for doing some small
thing for our beautiful Bangladesh.
